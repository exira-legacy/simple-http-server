simple-http-server
==================

When doing webdevelopment, sometimes you need to serve files from an HTTP host instead of using the filesystem.

Since setting up a webserver is too much overhead, we quickly wrote something to serve static files on a given port.

It is based on OWIN. If you can use it, enjoy!

## Usage

```simple-http-server <port to listen on> <root path to serve>```
